# 👋 Hi, I'm Tina Ni

Welcome to my coding portfolio! I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Your Major], and this repo highlights some of the software projects I've worked on.  
Many of these projects were developed through coursework in CIS 1100 and 1200 or built independently to explore new tools and ideas.

> ⚠️ Some projects are kept private to respect academic policies, but I'm happy to share access upon request!
